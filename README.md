# FlareTail.js

A JavaScript library for Firefox OS application development, consisting of WAI-ARIA-driven accessible widgets, a lightweight app framework, and convenient utility functions.

This is the core of [BzDeck](https://github.com/kyoshino/bzdeck) and not intended for general use at this time.

* `flaretail.widget.js`: a collection of WAI-ARIA-driven accessible widgets. This will use Web Components once these are implemented in Firefox.
* `flaretail.app.js`: a lightweight app framework featuring the MVC+events pattern and HTML5-compatible rendering.
* `flaretail.util.js`: convenient utility functions to handle variety of stuff in apps.
